### Image Classifier - Trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset

This is a multiclass image classifier using a CNN model that has been trained on the Keras integrated CIFAR-10 (labelled subset of tiny images) dataset.
The inbuilt CNN uses three layers roughly modelled after the VGG blocks in the CNN introduced by [this](http://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-1019/ijsrp-p9420.pdf) paper. 
There is built-in autotuning, made possible by KerasTuner. 

This classifier was programmed in order to join the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group's Computer Vision team. For more details see [docs.uwarg.com](https://www.docs.uwarg.com/bootcamp/computer-vision/).
